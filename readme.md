# Graphic Ideas

This repository holds a collection of ideas in graphical format.
Sometimes the best approach is unknown or partially-known, and when in that format
english fails as the best communication medium. A hybrid of language and language-less
communication tools must be used, therefore this repository leverages platforms
like `draw.io` to keep vector idea data in a raster format legible to a larger audience
while the idea is being developed into something buildable.
